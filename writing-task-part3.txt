1. A TCP finite state machine is implemented. TCP
    state changes are handled in api functions
    (connect, accpet, etc.) and receive function
    that processes incoming TCP segments.

2. Use Go-Back-N. On receiving a TCP segment with
    a unwanted SEQ number, discard it and send a
    duplicated ACK back to tell the sender to re-
    transmit; On receiving a TCP segment with a
    duplicated ACK number, resend the last segment.

3. Evaluation.
    ` make
    ` ./testTCPClient [IP] [Port] or ./testTCPServer [IP] [Port]
    ` # a little initialization (like open devices, find routes)
    ` # start tranfer data
